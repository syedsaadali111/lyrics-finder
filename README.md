## Reflection

The only disappointing part of this project was that MusixMatch API only returns partial song lyrics on the fre package. Nonetheless, I expanded my knowledge especially in these areas:
-React Hooks and Custom Hooks
-How to consume APIs using React
-Axios
-React Reducers

I wanted to include the usage of ContextAPI and React Routers in the project but quickly realized it would be overkill for a project of such a small size.
